# Storybook & UI

Storybook is home to all of our commonly used components. We use this app to visually show all components that we have within the project + automatic type documentation generated for each component.

All changes to storybook/ui must require a visual/code review.

- Visual reviews happen on a tool called [Chormatic](http://chromatic.com/) and these reviews will happen by our product team.

- Code reviews happen as normal on any changes to storybook/ui designs
